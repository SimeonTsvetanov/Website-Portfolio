# [Portfolio](https://simeontsvetanov.github.io/Website-Portfolio/)

This Page was created as part of a assignment form SoftUni. The main task I had, was to learn HTML and CSS and try to build a quick website about me. I've decided to create it as a Portfolio(stiyle-page). you can check the page [here](https://simeontsvetanov.github.io/Website-Portfolio/).

To run the website as a local server using [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html), just download the content of the flask floder.
